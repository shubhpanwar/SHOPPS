3. Connect your GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket account
4. Select the repository with your ShopHub code
5. Configure the build settings:
   - Build command: (leave blank)
   - Publish directory: `/`
6. Click "Deploy site"
7. (Optional) Go to Site settings → Domain management to set up a custom domain

### Option 2: GitHub Pages

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository
2. Go to repository Settings → Pages
3. Select the branch you want to deploy (usually `main` or `master`)
4. Set the folder to `/` (root)
5. Click "Save"

## Local Development

To run the website locally, simply open the `HTML/index.html` file in your browser.

For the best experience, use a local server:

```bash
# If you have Python installed
python -m http.server

# If you have Node.js installed
npx serve
```

Then access the site at `http://localhost:8000/HTML/index.html`

## Offline Support

The website includes service worker integration for offline access. To test:
1. Visit the site online
2. Turn off your internet connection
3. Refresh the page - you should still see the offline version
